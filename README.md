## TextBar License

TextBar requires a license (after the 7 day trial period). But, TextBar Mac licenses work with all versions of TextBar; v1, v2 and v3 - there is **no** upgrade fee for v3.

TextBar repesents a huge amount of work. If you would like to donate that would be very much appreciated.

## Latest Major Features

[Release Notes](http://www.richsomerfield.com/apps/textbar/releasenotes_textbar.html)

----

## New for TextBar v3.2.2

TextBar v3.2 has **major** new features over v3.1. But, as I've only recently released v3 it seems simpler to keep the v3 prefix.

### Show Charts in MenuBar

TextBar has an internal charting format to show charts in your MenuBar.

![TextBar Charts](Screenshots/webcharts.png)

Example here: [Bitcoin Close Price - USD](https://github.com/richie5um/TextBar-Recipes/blob/master/Items/Bitcoin%20Price%20USD%20(daily%20close).textbar?raw=true)

Example here: [Bitcoin Close Price - GBP](https://github.com/richie5um/TextBar-Recipes/blob/master/Items/Bitcoin%20Price%20GBP%20(daily%20close).textbar?raw=true)
> Note: Requires accessing www.coinbase.com in your Safari web browser to approve access first.

Open the script to see how it works.

More examples here: [TextBar Items](Items)
> Please submit them and I'll include them here :).

### Show HTML in MenuBar

TextBar can show HTML in your menubar - to give you ultimate control / customizability [sic].

![TextBar Web bar](Screenshots/webbar.png)

Example here: [Calendar](https://github.com/richie5um/TextBar-Recipes/blob/master/Items/Calendar.textbar?raw=true)

> Note: This example uses HTML for MenuBar and HTML for Popover.

### Added native support for Proxy Configuration in Preferences > Network

![TextBar Proxy Settings](Screenshots/proxysettings.png)

### Improvements to control in Preferences > Advanced

![TextBar Advanced](Screenshots/advanced.png)

----

## New for TextBar v3

Here are the major new items for v3...

### New Preferences UI

Complete re-written Preferences UI to make to easier to add and edit TextBar Items.

![TextBar Preferences](Screenshots/v3-textbar.png)

### Share TextBar Items

Use the new _Export_ button to save and share TextBar items with other TextBar users!

![TextBar Export](Screenshots/v3-export.png)

> I'm hoping to create a TextBar Items webpage at some point, for now email them to me or create a PullRequest and I'll add them to this page.

Note: The Export mechanism tries to detect if the script is a file. If it is, it'll automatically include the contents of the file. Otherwise it'll require any used files to be available on the other system. If in doubt, use the new file picker to select a script file - this will work with the new export mechanism.

The old Import/Export mechanism is still available for backups of your configured TextBar Items, but this does not include any file contents. It is intended for personal backups only.

### Shortcut to Refresh

You can now assign a shortcut key to a TextBar Item so you can quick refresh it. You could use use this as a simple script runner :-).

### Drag and Drop Images

Drag and Drop an image file onto the new preferences _image_ area to use your own image for your TextBar item.

![TextBar Image Drag Drop](Screenshots/v3-dragdrop.png)

### And numerous other fixes and improvements

----

## New for TextBar v2

Here are the major new items for v2...

### TextBar Live

[https://app.textbar.co](https://app.textbar.co)

> Do you have multiple Mac computers? Do you have remote or headless Mac servers? If so, then TextBar Live could be for you. TextBar Live allows you to see the status of all of your TextBar items, from all of your Macs, in a single place on the web.

**Note:** TextBar Live requires a monthly subscription.

* Register on [https://app.textbar.co](https://app.textbar.co)
* Create a subscription - note: the first 100 users get a free 1 device subscription.

* In TextBar Mac app > Preferences > Live:
    * Set your API Token - from [https://app.textbar.co/#/account](https://app.textbar.co/#/account)
    * And then enable

![TextBar Live](Screenshots/TextBarLive.png)

* View your TextBar items on the web:

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems with TextBar, you can enable logging. How to:
* Run 'defaults write com.RichSomerfield.TextBar ScriptLogging -bool true'
* Restart TextBar app
* Open the macOS Console app, and use 'TextBar' filter

![ConsoleApp](Screenshots/ConsoleApp.png)

To disable the extended logging:
* Run 'defaults delete com.RichSomerfield.TextBar ScriptLogging'
* Restart TextBar app

----

### Dynamic Values

Some of the TextBar values can be overriden from your script - so you can change them dynamically.

The dynamic section is identified by returning `----TEXTBAR----` in your script.

#### Dynamic Refresh

This script will override the refresh configured for this item (in TextBar preferences) with 5 secs.

    #!/bin/bash
    date
    echo "----TEXTBAR----"
    echo "REFRESH=5"


#### Dynamic Image

This script will override the image configured for this item (in TextBar preferences).

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Dynamic Image"
    echo "----TEXTBAR----"
    echo "IMAGE=_no_image-32"

The bundled images are stored in `/Applications/TextBar.app/Contents/Resources` (use 'Show Package Contents' to navigate into the app in Finder).

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Dynamic Image"
    echo "----TEXTBAR----"
    echo "IMAGE=coffee-32"

Prefix the image name with a ':' to load an image from a location on your machine.

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Dynamic Image"
    echo "----TEXTBAR----"
    echo "IMAGE=:$HOME/Pictures/RichS.jpeg"

#### HTML View

Show HTML in the TextBar view. For example (this is the output of the script):

    Display HTML
    <html>
        <head>
            <style>
                body {
                    font-family: "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;
                    font-weight: 300;
                    background-color: #3B9AD9;
                    color: #ffffff;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello from TextBar v2</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    ----TEXTBAR----
    VIEWTYPE=HTML

**Note:** You can also specify the ViewSize of the view.


    Display HTML
    <html>
        ...
    </html>
    ----TEXTBAR----
    REFRESH=10
    VIEWTYPE=HTML
    VIEWSIZE=600,400

![HTML View](Screenshots/HTMLView.png)

#### URL View

Show a webpage in the TextBar view.

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Display URL"
    echo "https://www.apple.com"
    echo "----TEXTBAR----"
    echo "VIEWTYPE=URL"
    echo "VIEWSIZE=$(( ( RANDOM % 200 ) + 500 )),$(( ( RANDOM % 200 ) + 300 ))"

**Note:** You can also specify the ViewSize of the view. This script creates a random sized view to demonstrate dynamic refresh too :-).

![URL View](Screenshots/URLView.png)

### Last Update
All TextBar items show the last updated time in the menu.

## HTML
From v1.3.3, TextBar can render _basic_ HTML into your TextBar item. The text must begin with ```<html>```, or end with ```</html>``` - must be in lowercase! - for it to be renderred as HTML.

The HTML support is fairly limited, it supports text and images. The text can be styled using embedded CSS, the images can't. Images should be resized to about 14x14.

### Hello World
    echo '<html><b>Hel</b>lo <i>wor</i>ld</html>'

### Display Image
    echo '<html><img src="http://www......."/></html>'
> You can't resize the image, so make sure it is 14x14 pixels for it to show correctly.

### CSS Styled Text
    cat '$HOME/scripts/apple.html'

> Download apple.html to your machine (to ~/scripts), and then add this to TextBar.

### Is my External drive mounted (with HTML Styled Text)?

## Actions
Since v1.7.15, TextBar support custom actions. TextBar has, when you click on the text in the menubar, added the text to the clipboard. Now you can customize that behaviour to perform your own actions. Effectively you can build your own menu bar apps (i.e. app launcher, fav folder launcher, ...).

### How To
* Go to TextBar -> Preferences
* Change the Action to 'Script'
* Add your script

### Details
When your script runs, TextBar will pass two environment variables into the shell. These provide you with the index (i.e. position from 0...end in the menu list), and the actual text.

The two environment variables are:

* TEXTBAR_INDEX
* TEXTBAR_TEXT

### Basic Example
* Add an action script of "echo $TEXTBAR_INDEX $TEXTBAR_TEXT > $HOME/output.txt"

When you trigger this action, it'll send the index and text to the output.txt file.

### Spotify Example
* Download the following files:
    * ShowSpotify.scpt
    * SpotifyControl.scpt
* Copy them to your ~/scripts folder
* Configure a Textbar item to have a script of:
    * osascript $HOME/scripts/ShowSpotify.scpt
* Configure the Textbar item to have an action script of:
    * osascript $HOME/scripts/SpotifyControl.scpt

You should now be able to skip tracks and play/pause from the Textbar item.

### Quick Finder Launcher Example
* Create a new TextBar item with an image
* Configure your script to be:
    * echo "\nOpen"
* Configure your action script to be:
    * osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to make new Finder window'

This'll only show the image in the menubar, but the 'Open' action will be shown in the menu.
![QuickLauncher](Screenshots/QuickLauncher.png)

If you want to have more launcher items, then you'll need to create the action script to check for the TEXTBAR_INDEX environment variable value in your action script.

### iCloud Tabs
* Download the following files:
    * icloudtabs.scpt
    * icloudtabsaction.scpt
* Copy them to your ~/scripts folder
* Create a new TextBar item
* Configure a Textbar item to have a script of:
    * echo 'Tabs' && python ~/scripts/icloudtabs.py
* Configure the Textbar item to have an action script of:
    * python ~/scripts/icloudtabsaction.py

This'll show your iCloud tabs from your other devices - it omits the tabs from the local machine.

    curl weather.mar.cx/Manchester,_UK | grep "<title>" | cut -d'>' -f2 | cut -d' ' -f1
> This is likely to break as it isn't entirely robust. Edit the location to get your weather.

### Unread Emails in Outlook
    osascript $HOME/scripts/CheckOutlookMail.scpt
> Download CheckOutlookMail.scpt to your machine (to ~/scripts), and then add this to TextBar.

### Next Meeting in Outlook
    osascript $HOME/scripts/OutlookNextMeeting.scpt
> Download OutlookNextMeeting.scpt to your machine (to ~/scripts), and then add this to TextBar.
> Edit OutlookNextMeeting.scpt if you want the text formatted differently.
> Note: This only looks 60 mins into the future. You can edit OutlookNextMeeting.scpt if you want longer. 

### Show the clipboard (text)
    pbpaste | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]$//' | sed -E 's/^(.{10}).+$/\1.../'
> This looks more complex than you might imagine. It; strips leading and trailing whitespace, displays only 10 chars (and if it exceeds 10 characters, it'll display the ellipsis).
> Obviously, if you 'Copy to Clipboard' on this, you'll get the truncated text - but, as it is already on the clipboard, you don't need to copy it :-).

### Character Count of current clipboard
    pbpaste | wc -c

## HTML
From v1.3.3, TextBar can render _basic_ HTML into your TextBar item. The text must begin with ```<html>```, or end with ```</html>``` - must be in lowercase! - for it to be renderred as HTML.

The HTML support is fairly limited, it supports text and images. The text can be styled using embedded CSS, the images can't. Images should be resized to about 14x14.

### Hello World
    echo '<html><b>Hel</b>lo <i>wor</i>ld</html>'
    
### Display Image
    echo '<html><img src="http://www......."/></html>'
> You can't resize the image, so make sure it is 14x14 pixels for it to show correctly.

### CSS Styled Text
    cat '$HOME/scripts/apple.html'
> Download apple.html to your machine (to ~/scripts), and then add this to TextBar.

### Is my External drive mounted (with HTML Styled Text)?
    [ -d /Volumes/MyExtDrive ] && echo "<html><font face=\"helveticaneue-thin\"> MyExtDrive mounted</font></html>" || echo "<html><font face=\"helveticaneue-thin\">MyExtDrive <font color=red><b>not</b></font> mounted</font></html>"
